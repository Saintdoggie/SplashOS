# ThingOS-fake
trying to make an os with my tiny brain, also I suck at coding yeaaa

basically this makes a canvas the size of the screen, then tries to simulate an operating system, like windows RG or something like it...

also, I have a  school chromebook and i don't like chromeOS and so I need to make this good enought to use in fullscreen
